#Practical Encryption#
##An introductory workshop for the not-so-paranoid##



####GNU Privacy Guard####
[GNU Privacy Guard][1] (GnuPG) is an open source and free implementation of the [OpenPGP][2] standard. It can be used to encrypt texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions. It is a widely used, powerful and basic tool and it will be used as the main program in this workshop to explain the basics of encryption in practice.
